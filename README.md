# AR_Kanji
This was a project to make an AR app where users could follow the displayed strokes of a chinese or japanese character to write it out. It has been discontinued due to a couple hardware limitations, but may be revisited later. I'm mainly uploading the files here so that I can find it in the future. The SVG database used here was taken from https://github.com/KanjiVG/kanjivg.
